# Recipe Shortcut for iOS

Everyone knows how annoying recipe websites can be. This is a small project that is meant to be used with [Apple Shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios).

This shortcut saves a recipe from Safari and creates a new Note, in the Apple Notes app.

Shortcuts allows you to run JavaScript on a web page, and the code in `index.js` is a good starting point that will scrape a lot of recipe websites. It targets the [Recipe Schema Markup](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/recipe) specification that Google outlines. Since this is an opt-in SEO feature for Google, unfortunately, this script won't work all the time.

## Getting Started
1. Link to my [iCloud Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/63686b6fa2964b8792c4fc88f0c84449).

I'm not very familiar with Shortcuts, but I believe, if you have not used the Shortcuts App before, you may need to use a shortcut, before you can download someone else's.

## Getting Started the Other Way
1. Open Shortcuts and click `+` to create a new shortcut.

2. Click `...`, Select 'Show in Share Sheet' to be ON. Share Sheet Types should be `Safari web pages`

<img src="./assets/recipe-shortcut-2.png" width="800"/>
<img src="./assets/recipe-shortcut-3.png" width="800"/>

3. Search for `Run JavaScript on Web Page` in the Actions. Add it to the shortcut panel. Note: It should automatically recieve an input from `Shortcut Input`.
4. Delete the provided code and add the code from `index.js`

<img src="./assets/recipe-shortcut-4.png" width="800"/>

5. Search for `If` in the search panel.
6. Add `does not have any value` to the If condition. Then you can add a Notification from the action panel if you would like. Drag the notification under the If condition.

<img src="./assets/recipe-shortcut-5.png" width="800"/>

7. Search for `Text` in the search panel, and add it under the `Otherwise` block.
8. Inside the text field for `Text`, you can start adding data from the `JavaScript Result` as `Dictionary` with the value for keys (see below). 

<img src="./assets/recipe-shortcut-6.png" width="800"/>
<img src="./assets/recipe-shortcut-7.png" width="800"/>

9. Search for `Create Note` in the Search panel, and add it under the `Text` block. (I have `Show Compose Sheet` off, but this is up to you)

<img src="./assets/recipe-shortcut-9.png" width="800"/>

10. If you would like the newly created note to be shown, add `Show Note` under the previous block.

<img src="./assets/recipe-shortcut-10.png" width="800"/>

Result:

<img src="./assets/recipe-shortcut-8.png" width="800"/>

## Dictionary / JSON Keys and values:

This is a sample object that is returned from the `JavaScript Result`. Depending on the site, this object appear different. Add the keys to the `Text` panel that you would like to include in the Note. 

The JavaScript function manipulates the original object for easier access and formatting, for instance: `recipeIngredient` and `myInstructions` are altered.
